# Getting Started with Create React App

hosted on vercel: https://react-tooltip-kappa.vercel.app/

This is a tool tip app , designed based on the progress features in gitHub and Leetcode

## How to use this app
1) hover over any tool you will get the tool tip of the tool

## components used
1) Tool - any button or a container you need a tip
2) Tool Tip- the the component appear when you hover over a tool 

## Tool Component

1)a simple div square style  with a background color and some information like commit

## Tool Tip Component

1) This componnet has 4 divs with 4 direction 
   1) Top arrow is displayed based on direction prop = 0
   2) Right arrow is displayed based on direction prop = 1
   1) Left arrow is displayed based on direction prop = 2
   1) Down arrow is displayed based on direction prop = 3

   Style for arrow
   1) margin on two side wiht a color and opposite side with transparent style

    
2) The body div displays the information passed as a props , to make it reusable for any tool


## hooks used
1) use state - 
     1)to store the hover on and off feature 
     2) to store the direction in a sate and pass as props to  tool and tool tip

## styles
1) css only 

## imporovements to the app

1) animations
2) creating multi page features  with reusable tooltip components


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
